# ✅ Manifest Fixed

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Invalid 'key' field
The original `manifest.json` had an invalid `key` field that caused this error:
```
Failed to load extension
Error: Value 'key' is missing or invalid.
Could not load manifest.
```

**Fix:** Removed the invalid `key` field from `manifest.json`. The `key` field is automatically generated by Chrome when you load an unpacked extension and should NOT be manually added.

### Issue 2: Invalid keyboard shortcut 'F9'
Chrome extensions don't support function keys (F1-F12) directly in the manifest:
```
Failed to load extension
Error: Invalid value for 'commands[1].default': F9.
Could not load manifest.
```

**Fix:** Changed the default shortcut to `Ctrl+Shift+U` (Windows/Linux) and `Command+Shift+U` (Mac). You can manually change it to F9 after loading the extension.

## Current Status
✅ `manifest.json` is now valid JSON
✅ No invalid `key` field
✅ Extension should load without errors

## How to Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `LinkCopier` folder (either `/home/administrator/Workspace/LinkCopier` or `/home/administrator/Workspace/BOTS/LinkCopier`)
6. Extension should load successfully!

## How to Change Shortcut to F9

After loading the extension:

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find "LinkCopier - Real-time URL to Google Sheets"
3. Click the pencil icon (✏️) next to "Copy current URL to Google Sheet"
4. Press **F9** on your keyboard
5. Click outside the input to save
6. ✅ F9 is now set!

**Note:** Chrome allows F1-F12 keys to be set manually through the shortcuts page, but they cannot be pre-configured in the manifest.json file.

## Next Steps

After loading the extension:
1. You'll get an Extension ID automatically
2. Follow **INSTALL.md** to set up OAuth
3. Update the `oauth2.client_id` in `manifest.json` with your actual Client ID
4. Reload the extension
5. Test with F9!

## Note About the `key` Field

The `key` field in manifest.json is:
- ❌ NOT required for unpacked extensions
- ❌ NOT manually created
- ✅ Automatically generated by Chrome
- ✅ Only needed for published extensions in Chrome Web Store

For development (unpacked extensions), you should NEVER manually add a `key` field.

**Status:** Fixed and ready to load! 🎉
